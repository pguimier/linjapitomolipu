`linja pi tomo lipu` is a monotype font to write texts in Toki Pona hieroglyphs.

It was created and used on this website : https://web.archive.org/web/20190222101854/http://www.tomo-lipu.net:80/
The site used it with optimized svg signs. This is a font conversion.
The site is no longer online.
I don't know the author of the site, but I would like to. If someone knows it, contact me by Telegram/Reddit/Discord on channel toki-pona-taso.
Then I will update compyright notice.

Toki pona is a constructed language using only about 120 words.
