`linja pi tomo lipu` is a monotype font to write texts in Toki Pona hieroglyphs.

It was created and used on this website : https://web.archive.org/web/20190222101854/http://www.tomo-lipu.net:80/ (the site is no longer online)

The site used it with optimized svg signs. This is a font conversion.

The author of the 120 vanilla glyphs is Christophe Bouteiller which created also the web site under drupal with a word conversion script. 

Christoph kindly allowed me to reuse his creation, thanks to him !

~~I don't know the author of the site, but I would like to. If someone knows it, contact me by Telegram/Reddit/Discord on channel toki-pona-taso. Then I will update copyright notice.~~
